README:

Based on the port from Thinky Head Software which can be located here: http://www.thinkyhead.com/fortune/download/bsd-fortune-14l

Modified by John P. Neumann (http://AnimateShmanimate.com) - As a note, I'm not a C programmer and I don't play one on tv, so if I screwed it up, lemme know. ;)

INSTALLATION:

This installation defaults to /usr/local/bin for the fortune script and installs the fortune cookies (fortunes) to /usr/local/var/fortunes. If you wish to change these locations open the Makefile and they're located on lines 27, 28, 29. The only caveat is that if you change the DATAPATH, make sure you change the TRUEDATAPATH as well, leaving the /fortunes on the end of it.
