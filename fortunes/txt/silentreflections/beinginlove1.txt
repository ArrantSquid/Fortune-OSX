Oh I'm just a man, that's the way I was made...
I'm not to good at saying what you need me to say..

I hope you know what I mean when I say 'Me too.'

Nervous and scared I asked you for a dance
All of my buddies said, "Yeah right, fat chance
She'll never go for a good ol' boy like you."
But somewhere between my stutter and stammer,
Before I could ask, you'd already answered
And to my surprise you said that you'd love to...

And they all laughed when I stepped on your toes
But they got quiet when you moved in close
They lost their smiles
When they knew they lost their chance
My two left feet couldn't do a right thing
I looked like a fool but felt like a king
Oh, they got a laugh...
But look who got... the last dance...

When I need you, I just close my eyes and I'm with you,
and all that I so want to give you, it's only a heartbeat away.
When I need love, I hold out my hands and I touch love,
I never knew there was so much love, keeping me warm night and day.

the telephone can't take the place of your smile.
But you know I won't be traveling forever...
It's cold out, but hold out, and do like I do...

She felt an ache, a phsyical ache to be with him and to sit on the floor
by his chair while he stroked her hair. She hadn't known it was possible

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is
not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered,
it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices
with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always
perseveres. Love never fails.

I love you. Not the kind they taught you about and I didn't know this either
but love doesn't make things nice. It breaks your heart. It makes things a
mess, we aren't here to make things perfect. The snowflakes are perfect. The
stars are perfect, not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and to break our
hearts and love the wrong people and die. The storybooks are bullshit.

I'll take my trembling fingers
And I'll lift up your veil
Then I'll take you home
And with wild abandon
Make love to you just like a true companion...

You and I
My hand is lonely for your clasping, dear;
My ear is tired waiting for your call.
I want your strength to help, your laugh to cheer;
Heart, soul and senses need you, one and all.
I droop without your full, frank sympathy;
We ought to be together - you and I;
We want each other so, to comprehend
The dream, the hope, things planned, or seen, or wrought.
Companion, comforter and guide and friend,
As much as love asks love, does thought ask thought.
Life is so short, so fast the lone hours fly,
We ought to be together, you and I.

We stood in your room and laughed out loud. Suddenly the laughter died, we
were caught in an eye to eye. We sat on the floor and did we sit close. I
smell your thoughts and thought. Do you want to touch a lot like me? Too
scared to say a thing. I left your house and kicked myself. I put those
feelings on a shelf to die. I guess I'm not the gambling type but think of
what the two of us had lost. I needed some time to think it out. 7-11
parking lot. A toothless women turned and stopped. I gave her a dime and a
chesterfield. She leaned down and kissed my cheek, I was scared but it felt
sweet. She asked me if I had a name. I told her I was glued up on some chick.
We sat and smoked against the wall. Drank a beer and felt the chill of fall.
I took my car and drove it down the hill by your house. I drove so fast.
The wind couldn't cool me down, so I turned it around and came back up. You
were waiting on your step, steam showing off your breath, and water in your
eyes. We pulled each other into one, parkas clinging on the lawn and kissed
right there. Said all my chicks smoke these things and handed her a
chesterfield king. Held your hand and watched tv and traced the little lines
along your palm.

It had to be you, It had to be you,

Some others I've seen, might never be mean,
Might never be cross, or try to be boss, but
They wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults
I love you still, It had to be You,
Wonderful you, It had to be you.
