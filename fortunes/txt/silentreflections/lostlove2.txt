and I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin

My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;

Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;
For nothing now can ever come to any good.

I cannot remember our love.

Yesterday morning, just before noon
I passed a girl wearing your old perfume
and I stopped and stared.
I could almost see you standing there.
Don't get me wrong, I'm almost over you,
But now and then I like to go walkin' through
Some of our old times, even though I realized.

I'll have another chance, I'll find another girl.
I'll see another day, I'll build another world.
I'll start another life, just like you told me too.
I'll find another love, but there will never be.
Another you.

but I do...

Heard they crowded the floor,

When the moon is bright, on a saturday night,
There's a thousand stars in the sky-
On a winding road, her memory flows-
She'll face the fact- she wants to go back..

She opens her heart to an old memory-
She closes her eyes and she smiles.
Just ask her if she ever thinks about me,
She'll say: every once in a while, every once in a while.

She tries to forget, but she hasn't yet-
Not a single day goes by....

I've known for some time
It wasn't a big surprise
You can't deny
Leaving was on your mind
Too many nights I've cried myself to sleep
Afraid of the dark
baby that hurts too deep
Although I was naive I wasn't half
so blind as to believe in all those
lies you told to me
But there is just one thing I need to know
before you turn to go
Did you ever really love me?

My hands are tied...
