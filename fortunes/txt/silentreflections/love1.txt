Love
Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet understanding,
mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving.  It is loyaltly through
good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes
allowances for human weaknesses.

Love is content with the present, it hopes for the future, and it
does not brood over the past. It’s the day-in and day-out chronicle
of irritations, problems, compromises, small disappointments, big
victories and working toward common goals.

If you have love in your life, it can make up for a great many things
that are missing. If you don’t have love in your life, no matter what
else there is, it’s not enough.

Have you even been in love? Horrible, isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable.
It opens your chest and it opens your heart and it means someone can get
inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses. You build up
this whole armor, for years, so nothing can hurt you, then one stupid
person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your
stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They don't ask for it. They
do something dumb one day like kiss you, or smile at you, and then your
life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It
eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase
like "maybe we should just be friends" or "how very perceptive" turns
into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not
just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a
body-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.

A soulmate is someone who has locks that fit our keys, and keys to fit our
locks. When we feel safe enough to open the locks, our truest selves step
out and we can be completely and honestly who we are; we can be loved for
who we are and not for who we're pretending to be. Each unveils the best
part of the other. No matter what else goes wrong around us, with that
one person we're safe in our own paradise. Our soulmate is someone who
shares our deepest longings, our sense of direction. When we're two balloons,
and together our direction is up, chances are we've found the right person.
Our soulmate is the one who makes life come to life.

What, if there was a man.
And what, if there were two women who loved him.
And now I tell you, he loved one of them.
But what, if the women were best friends and the loved one wanted her friend
	and him together?
What, if he still loved the other one more?
Should he have taken the second one,
Or was it the best thing going on alone and saying goodbye to both of them?

Love is like a wonderful, red rose
as long as still living in the garden of your heart.
But if someone picks this wonderful rose,
she will die.

After a while you might forget this rose and
find a rose which is even more beautiful than the first.
And I wish you well with this rose charming her so much,
that you know how to keep someone else from picking her.

Love is like a wonderful, red rose.
And if there is someone, who is loved so much,
the rose becomes more and more beautiful until she is in full bloom.
But if someone, who is loved so much, says goodbye, just for fun,
the rose begins to wither, love is fading like a rose.

But love is like a Rose of Jericho, too.
Someone, who is loved so much, is able to water the rose
by just writing a letter, making him happy.
And the rose would open her bud and might even be more beautiful than before.

And he forgives her, and a dream comes true...

When they made love she was disappointed. He did not appear to believe in
unhurried pleasure, and thought the things she suggested he might do to
please her very awkaward at the least. But it hardly mattered, since
what mattered was the fact of having a lover. She liked snuggling up to
him, liked kissing him along the sides of his face - his cheeks were
just beginning to be a trifle flabby but would still be good for several
years - and loved to write him silly letters - scorching with passion and
promises of abandon - that made her seem head over heels in love. She
enjoyed writing the letters because she enjoyed feeling to her full
capacity and for as long as possible the excitement having a new lover
brought. It was the kind of excitement she'd felt years ago in high school
and perhaps twice in college (once when she'd fallen for a student and
once when she was seduced - with her help and consent - by a teacher),
and she recognized it as a feeling to be enjoyed for all it was worth.
Her body felt on fire, her heart jumped in her breast, her pulse raced
- she was aware, for the first time in years, of actually _needing_ to
make love.

the only meaning."

The most wonderful of all things in life, I believe, is the discovery of
another human being with whom one's relationship has a glowing depth,

love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing, it cannot be
found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it. It is a sort

There is no difficulty that enough love will not conquer; no disease
that enough love will not heal; no door that enough love will not open;
no gulf that enough love will not bridge; no wall that enough love will
not throw down; no sin that enough love will not redeem.  It makes no
difference how deeply seated may be the trouble; how hopeless the outlook;
how muddled the tangle; how great the mistake.  A sufficient realization
of love will dissolve it all. If only you could love enough you would
be the happiest and most powerful being in the world.

Fear gets in the way of love, and I've discovered that fear, and not hate,
