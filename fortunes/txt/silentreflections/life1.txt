I've paid my dues, time after time
I've done my sentence, but committed no crime
And bad mistakes, I've made a few..
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through..
I've taken my bows and my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it..I thank you all
But its been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise.
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose.."

"The best thing for being sad," replied Merlin, beginning to puff and blow,
"is to learn something. That's the only thing that never fails. You may grow
old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to
the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the
world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in
the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then -- to learn.
Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the
mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or
distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you.
Look what a lot of things there are to learn.

God has given us free will to make love and life meaningful. This creates a
critical risk because we now have the ability to destroy our universe if we
choose not to love. However...it is only in this critical time that the
archetype of the miracle can appear. When one believes in love and miracles
divine intervention can occur. We have an infinite number of choices ahead,
but a finite number of endings. They are destruction and death or love and
healing. If we choose the path of love we save ourselves and our universe.
Let us choose love and life.

If I had my life to live over, I'd try to make more mistakes next time. I
would relax, I would limber up, I would be crazier than I've been on this
trip. I know very few things I'd take seriously any more. I'd certainly
be less hygenic... I would take more chances, I would take more trips, I
would scale more mountains, I would swim more rivers, and I would watch
more sunsets. I would eat more icecream and fewer beans. I would have more
actual troubles and fewer imaginary ones. Oh, I've had my moments, and if
I had to do it all over again, I'd have many more of them, in fact I'd try
not to have anything else, just moments, one after another, instead of
living so many years ahead of my day. If I had it to do all over again,
I'd travel lighter, much lighter than I have. I would start barefoot earlier
in the spring, and I'd stay that way later in the fall. And I would ride
more merry-go-rounds, and catch more gold rings, and greet more people and
pick more flowers and dance more often. If I had it to do all over again -
but you see, I don't.

In some way, however small and secret, each of us is a little mad. Everyone
is lonely at bottom and cries to be understood; but we can never entirely
understand someone else, and each of us remains part stranger even to those
who love us...It is the weak who are cruel; gentleness is to be expected only
from the strong... Those who do not know fear are not really brave, for
courage is the capacity to confront what can be imagined. 

[...] You can understand people better if you look at them - no matter how
old or impressive they may be - as if they are children. For most of us
never mature; we simply grow taller...Happiness comes only when we push
our brains and hearts to the farthest reaches of which we are capable. The
purpose of life is to matter - to count, to stand for something, to have it
make a difference that we lived at all.

You knew exactly what you were doin' but left me shattered anyway
It just kills me to see you runnin' to the comfort of strangers

And it's left me with nothin' but the comforts of strangers

You left me so defenseless and vanished like a ghost

He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was one of those
rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come
across four or five times in a life. It faced - or seemed to face--the whole
external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an
irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you
wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in
yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at
your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished.

Freedom is the right to choose. In America you can choose how to work, how
to vote, how to worship, how to love. You will face hard choices; if you
choose wrong, you are free to choose again. Freedom has limits. You are not
free to break your country's laws. And freedom does not come free. if you
want your children to enjoy its blessing, freedom demands devotion - sometimes
the last full measure of devotion.
