I could not, at any age, be content to take my place in a corner by the
fireside and simply look on. Life was meant to be lived. Curiousity must
be kept alive. The fatal thing is the rejection. One must never, for

After a while you learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and
	chaining a soul,
And you learn that love doesn't mean leaning and company doesn't mean security,
And you begin to learn that kisses aren't contracts and presents aren't
	promises,
And you begin to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes open
	- with the grace of a woman, not the grief of a child,
And you learn to build your roads on today, because tomorrow's ground is too
	unstable for plans, and futures have a way of falling down in
	mid-flight.
After a while, you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much, so
	you plant your own garden and decorate your own soul instead of
	waiting for someone to bring you flowers.
And you learn that you really can endure... that you really are strong...
	and you really do have worth.
And you learn and learn... with every goodbye you learn.

Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
