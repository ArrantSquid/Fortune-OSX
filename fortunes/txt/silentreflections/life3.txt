It has never been easy for me to understand the obliteration of time, to
accept, as others seem to do, the swelling and corresponding shrinkage of
seasons or the conscious acceptance that one year has ended and another
begun. There is something here that speaks of our essential helplessness
and how the greater substance of our lives is bound up with waste and
opacity. Even the sentence parts seize on the tongue, so that to say
"Twelve years passed" is to deny thefact of biographical logic. How can
so much time hold so little, how can it be taken from us? Months, weeks,
days, hours misplaced -- and the most precious time of life, too, when
our bodies are at their greatest strength, and open, as they never will
again, to the onslaught of sensation.
