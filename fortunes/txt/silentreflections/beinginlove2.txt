I gently touched her hand:she gave
A look that my soul did enslave
I pressed her rebel lips in vain
They rose up to be pressed again
Thus happy I no further meant
Than to be pleased and innocent

On her eyes my eyes did stay
Over her smooth limbs my hands did stray
Each sense was ravished with delight
And my soul stood prepared for flight
Blame me not if for at last I meant
To be more pleased than innocent

The wasted tears of love in vain

Now with all my heart, I beg you to stay

I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you
an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle
up over your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. I love that after
I spend a day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes and I
love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at
night. And it's not because I'm lonely and it's not because it's New Year's
Eve. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend your life
with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.

There's been one woman, only one. And my life is moving swift as a racing
boat, so much I've changed and grown with her. Each other's company our sole
education and entertainment, our life together had grown like summer clouds.
Ask a woman and a man sailing their boat over oceans, aren't you bored? how
*do* you pass the time? They smile. Not enough hours in the year to do what
needs to be done! 

Same for us. Delighted we had been, laughed sometimes till we could not stand,
scared now and then, tender, desperate, joyous, discovering, passionate ...
but not one second bored.

With all my heart I love you, baby
Stay with me and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave, 'cause I believe

Hear me calling out your name

I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away
It'll always be this way...."

Desire, the difference between friendship and love. Removing our tensions in

Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away

I'm so glad I found you
I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you
Take you to the good times
See you through the bad times
Whatever it takes is what I'm going to do
Let 'em say we're crazy
What do they know?
Put your arms around me baby don't ever let go
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby we can make if we're heart to heart
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

What a sight for my eyes to see you in sleep.
Could it stop a sunrise, hearing you weep?
You're not seen, you're not heard but I stand by my word.
Came a thousand miles just to catch you while you're smiling.
What a day for laughter and walking at night.
Me following after, your hand holding tight,
and the memory stays clear with a song that you hear.
If I can but make the words awake the feeling.
What a reason for waiting and dreaming of dreams.
So is holding your faith in possible schemes,
That are born in the sight of the wind blowing by,
While the dimming light brings an end to a night of loving.

Well i want to make love to you tonight,
I can't wait till the morning has come.
And I know that the time is just right.
And straight into my arms you will run when you come.
My heart will be waiting to make sure,
That you will never be alone there.
And then all my dreams will come true dear,
There and then i will make you my own.
Every time i touch you, you just tremble inside.
And i know how much you want me that you can't hide.
Can i just have one more moondance with you my love.

Of the light of music
