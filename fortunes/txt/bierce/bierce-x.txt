X

in our alphabet being a needless letter has an added invincibility to
the attacks of the spelling reformers, and like them, will doubtless
last as long as the language. X is the sacred symbol of ten dollars, and
in such words as Xmas, Xn, etc., stands for Christ, not, as is popular
supposed, because it represents a cross, but because the corresponding
letter in the Greek alphabet is the initial of his name -- 'Xristos'.
If it represented a cross it would stand for St. Andrew, who testified
upon one of that shape. In the algebra of psychology x stands for Woman's
mind. Words beginning with X are Grecian and will not be defined in this
standard English dictionary.
