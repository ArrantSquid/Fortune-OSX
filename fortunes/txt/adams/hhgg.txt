`That's the display department.'
`With a torch.'
`Ah, well the lights had probably gone.'
`So had the stairs.'
`But look you found the notice didn't you?'

by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had already become incorporated
into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented. It

Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but
wanted no truck with it."

"`You know,' said Arthur, `it's at times like this, when I'm trapped

mother told me when I was young.'
`Why, what did she tell you?'
